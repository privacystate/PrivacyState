Welcome to [PrivacyState](https://privacystate.org) resources repository. This will be the place where everyone can collaborate building up the Internet's Privacy Guide. We aim to be one of the most reliable and trustworthy guide in terms of privacy.

## Considerations
* The guide versions will be strongly revised and discussed before being published.
* Any complains about a Guide's version can be issued on the Repository's issues tab or in the [suggestions.md](https://github.com/privacystate/PrivacyState/blob/master/suggestions.md) file.

## Contributing

This guides are not aiming in any way to be a source of income for anyone. This guides are completelly free, for everyone and will never be biased for money or anything like that. We encourage experts on Privacy, Security and Anonimity fields to contribute here.

### Adding content
The way new content should be added is the following:
* Study the product/service you are about to add. You don't want to harm other users.
* Once studied, write down why this service is not bad. (Not why is good).
* Discuss with others if necessary.
* Test the service if possible.
* Add the service to the list and wait for it to be approved or rejected.

### Rejections and Approvals
This do not depend on any subjective matter. It is all about objectivity. We will read the Privacy Policies, terms of usage, hear opinions, test the product, ask, contact the provider (if necessary). It is normal for a new service to take some time to be added.
